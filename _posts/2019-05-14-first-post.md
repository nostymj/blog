My first blog post is a medium-long one and is mainly an introduction to what this blog is about and a very brief about myself paragraph. I first encountered Japanese mahjong when I was 15 years old and have been playing casually on and off for the last 10 years. I have only seriously started playing around 3 years ago and have since then joined the online mahjong community and participated in numerous events.

At the time I'm writing this first post, I want to limit the scope of this blog so that it is less about Japanese mahjong tips or my own mahjong journey and more on trying to touch on some of the  unwritten English topics in the Japanese Mahjong world, community and other tidbits. There are already a number of great blogs and materials on strategy, analysis, news, and events, however I'm hoping to initially take this blog in a different direction. I have a mish-mash of topics in my head that I think would be useful as I can't find any English and sometimes even Japanese materials online!

Another part of the reason why I wanted to start my own blog is that I thought that some of the material I wanted to cover involve an element of gambling or are more opinionated which would be unpalatable to other community websites. As this is private blog, I'm able to write a bit more liberally on these topics that can't be covered elsewhere and in greater length than on Twitter. (and I also wanted to try out Jekyll and avoid Wordpress :smile:)

I will also try to link any other useful websites and materials I can find on this blog on the more traditional topics so that people can browse through. There are some great material and content out there and I want to give full credits to those who wrote, coded and analysed everything.
