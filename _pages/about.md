Hi.

A brief introduction:

I have played Japanese mahjong on an off casually since high school after getting into the game by accident. I have only seriously started playing around 2017 and have been fully obsessed with it ever since.

This blog is a mahjong blog with the cinematic extras, and will initially try to cover topics that aren't blogged about much in the English community. It will mainly cover Japanese Riichi Mahjong but will occasionally cover other variants.
